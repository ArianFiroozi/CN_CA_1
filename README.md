## About the Project

In this project we want to create a QT application using WebRTC that allows users to communicate with audio calls. Connection type used to stablish communication is p2p and is implemented with libdatachannel library which provides WebRTC for c++.
Although the goal was to implement audio calls, audio packets sent through tracks did not play the audio so this code only successfuly transfers text messages between peers.
